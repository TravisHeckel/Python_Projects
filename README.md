## Introduction

### [Nice or Mean Project](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/Python_Projects/tree/main/Nice_or_Mean_Project)
This is a basic game of decision making, it will seek the users name and has catch statments in case they already have their name inputed and chose to play again. Then the game spends time asking you situational questions and will respond with both a message and sound based on your chosen responses.

### [Python challenges](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/Python_Projects/tree/main/Python%20Challenges)
These challenges reflect different aspects of python including the ability to read ranges of numbers, set date and time, access databases and generate a quick page. It also includes scripts and how we can load other ones into our program.

## Django projects
These projects listed below specifically used Django framework in creating these. It has a variety of challenges given to me and I completed while In the Tech Academy. 
### [Checkbook Project](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/Python_Projects/tree/main/Django_Projects/Django_Checkbook_Project)
This checkbook project was a website that allowed for users to include monitary transactions. It keeps a record of the transactions and will calculate the difference based on what is included.
### [Djange University](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/Python_Projects/tree/main/Django_Projects/djangoUniversity_Project)
This program allows for you to create different University buildings and include different categories(courses) for each of those university buildings.
### [pycharm Project](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/Python_Projects/tree/main/Django_Projects/pyCharm%20Project)
This was my first project using pyCharm and I was able to experience setting up a basic car object in the terminal and I could change the speed and capabilities of this car.
### [Tech_project](https://github.com/TravisHeckel/Python_Projects/tree/main/Django_Projects/tech_project)
This was a full fledge website that allowed for a hotel that does room service. I create an admin that can access andchange what items can be included on the menu and price changes. But overall users can add or delete what they want from the menu.
