                                      ##LIVE PROJECT USING PYTHON

#Introduction
  At The Tech Academy I had the opportunity to be a part of a two-week sprint working on a live project with other developers. We worked as a team building a full-stack web application using primarily Python. We where able to add to the project as well as correct bugs found in the project. During the project I was able to utilize Django and SQlite. I was able to build some experience in project management and team building skills as we reviewed over our work and any problems that may have hindered us. I have included an explanation below that summarizes the work I provided in this project and the code that is linked in this repository. 
  
#CRUD Functionality
 Our primary goal starting was the create CRUD Functionality for our part of the application. I started with a new application that I connected with the MainProject by registering URl and setting URL path for each of the pages I included. We added the basic functions that rendered the Home page and added minimal content and styling (using CSS). 
 
#Creation of Model
  In the models.py file, I setup the model including all the categories that the user would need. I used SQlite to create a object manager, I added a template for creating a new item, as well as a page that displayed it (forms.py). In this model I also created default answers for several of the categories using widgets. I connected the new page and made sure it would save the users informaton given to the database.  
  
#Read, update and Delete
  Another view was created that displayed all items that where currently input into the database. it was on this page you had several buttons created that allowed you to view the details of a specific item, update that item, or delete it. I made sure to use validation in all these buttons (including creating). I made sure to include a Pagination to allow multiple pages if enough items where included. I recognized that I had duplicates of several code and was taught by a fellow teamate about DRY. I went back thru my code stream lining it and simplifying some of the code so that I didn't need to have it in multiple spots.

#additional skills:
*I built up habits of saving my work constantly as I progressed as well as Debugging.
  
*we coordinated our work using pycharm and Azure Devops, keeping us well organize and all of us working across the same versions.

*I learned the true value of GitHub as our team had multiple branches at work and several times we came across some merge conflicts and I was able to practice reviewing and creating a merge resolution. I also organized files and made sure to ignore specific files that would have otherwise affected the project at large.
  
*As a team we completed our daily standups everyday. We discussed any problems, what work needs to be done and what deadlines are set.

*I had a lot of time spent working on the layout and design with HTML and CSS.
