### Django_Projects

  This file contains examples of my work in designing several projects using django.

#Django_CheckBook_Project
  This creates a website that allows for people to create users and record transactions that they make. It will keep the record and allow for editing those transactions later.
#Django_University_Project
  This is a standard website for creating courses and different university buildings.
#Hello_world_Project
  This was one of the first examples of a website that greeted and recorded users visiting their website.
#Tech_project 
  This one creates a fake hotel that caters with specific food. Users can edit, add or delete them.
